We are porting swift code to a cross-platform, python3, qt6 gui program.

We are using Pyside6 as our import of choice, not PyQt6. Maintain Qt best practices.

We are using string templates to construct scheme programs based on the user's input.

We launch scheme programs, and support interop between them and the UI.

The scheme templates are not to be altered. 

The project will be small, simple, and minimal. The UI will be basic and functional.

Libraries to be used are to be kept to a STRICT minimum.

We will NOT be implementing spinners, just timers.

We have implemented in constants, a simple logging system. Use WARN, GOOD, INFO, DEBUG for console logs.

Clean up any #...Other cleanup steps, or TODOs, or excessive comments.
