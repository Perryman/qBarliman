Thanks to Kent Dybvig, Andy Keep, and Cisco Systems for releasing Chez Scheme under an open source license.

The definition of `letrec` in the main interpreter is based based on Dan Friedman's code, using the "half-closure" approach from Reynold's definitional interpreters.

Greg Rosenblatt has been improving the search and the miniScheme interpreter to improve synthesis performance, greatly improving performance on many of the synthesis problems.

Barliman is intended to be an improved version of the very crude 'miniKanren playground' I showed at my 2016 PEPM tutorial on miniKanren: [https://github.com/webyrd/minikanren-playground]
